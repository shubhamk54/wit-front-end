## Distributed Reduce Reuse Recycle and Management System

- We are proposing ‘DR3AMS’- Distributed Reduce Reuse Recycle and Management System, an online portal. Using this portal, users can donate unnecessary goods like medicines, e-waste, clothes they have at home. Those collected goods will be given to people who need them or will be recycled if they are not in a usable state. 
- Volunteers from NGOs or any person interested in delivering the goods can deliver them to needy people.
- This way we are enabling people to recycle, reuse and reduce unnecessary goods and contribute towards sustainability.  

## Collection of goods via online portal

- Users can donate unused medicines, e-waste, clothes, etc using a donation form available on the website. 
- In that form, they will be providing details of goods and also whether they want to deliver goods themselves to the receiver. 

## Distribution of goods to the needy people

- Users can themselves search for the required product in the portal.
- Interesed Users can volunteer to collect the goods from the donar and provide it to needy/NGO's.
- NGO's can onboard themselves and access portal to find the products in need and re distribute them among the needy people.
- E-waste can be collected by concerned authorities and can either dispose it off in proper way or recycle it.

Advantage :

Since majority of Indian population (specially elderly population and rural population) do not have knowledge about disposale of goods like medicines and e-waste, This portal will be give them assurance that these unnecessary things are either reused, reclycled and reduced properly so that it will cause less harm to environment.


## Conclusion
