## Distributed Reduce Reuse Recycle and Management System

- We are proposing ‘DR3AMS’- Distributed Reduce Reuse Recycle and Management System, an online portal. Using this portal, users can donate unnecessary goods like medicines, e-waste, clothes they have at home. Those collected goods will be given to people who need them or will be recycled if they are not in a usable state. 
- Volunteers from NGOs or any person interested in delivering the goods can deliver them to needy people.
- This way we are enabling people to recycle, reuse and reduce unnecessary goods and contribute towards sustainability.
