## Short description

### What's the problem?

Each household contains unused medicines, electronic devices, clothes, etc. Most of the time it’s because they are past their shelf life, or it is because we no longer need them. Often it ends up in the dustbin and its journey ahead hampers the environment. The chemicals used in these products or parts of them, if placed in the right hand at the right time, might benefit someone who really needs it and thus be reused, or help in proper disposal by recycling them. Currently, there is no such way by which a person can actually help in getting these products at the right place, so that they are reused and recycled ahead, and thus benefiting the environment in the long run. 

### How can technology help?

With the technological advancement and widespread internet facilities around the world, having a one stop online portal where people can put across the details of the products which they want to be reused, or recycled, and help them reach the needy, will bridge the gap, which currently exists. 

### The idea

We are proposing ‘DR3AMS’- Distributed Reduce Reuse Recycle and Management System, an online portal helping users connect and contribute towards sustainability. This portal will have the capability where user can:- 
1. Create a new request for the item that they wish to provide for reuse/recycle.
2. Other users can go through the product list and connect with the user who has created the request.
3. NGOs can go through product catalogue and pick items that they help in getting recycled or reused ahead.
